A simple repository with a Windows Sandbox (WSB) configuration file and several tools to help you get started.

## What Tools are contained within this package?

## Can I edit the configuration file?
Yes of course! Please edit the configuration file to fit your needs. Please review the Windows Sandbox documentation here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-isolation/windows-sandbox/windows-sandbox-overview

## Disclaimers
I did not make any of the tools included. The only thing I, admrotob, have made is the package to put all of these tools together. This Windows Sandbox configuration file is of my own creation in this specific way; however, the included tools that I've added to the environment are not.
